the upper chamber - and then be signed off by President Joe Biden.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But there is deep disagreement about spending among the Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress, which they control.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A right-wing faction in the House is demanding deep cuts and wants to stop further funding of the war in Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They had voted down attempts by the party leadership, headed by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, to bring a deal to the floor of the House.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The right-wing factions had vowed to topple Mr McCarthy as leader if moderates passed any solution with Democratic support.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At his Saturday news conference, Mr McCarthy challenged those who oppose him to "bring it", adding: "There has to be an adult in the room."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Saturday's CR passed on a bipartisan basis - but 90 members of Mr McCarthy's party voted against it.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The bill notably excluded any funding for Ukraine, spending cuts or border policy changes - raising the likelihood of a fresh fight over the issues in the coming weeks.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3C5E/production/_105245451_mediaitem105245448.jpg.webp alt="AFP A US government employee talks on the phone as she looks out of a closed Smithsonian museum in Washington, DC on January 18, 2019" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">AFP</span><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">How does it affect daily life?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">If no deal is struck by 17 November, then the US will have its first shutdown since early 2019.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">More than 1.3 million active-duty members of the military and thousands of air traffic controllers will be among those working without pay.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In recent shutdowns, the military were still getting paid because the defence department had a separate funding deal but that has not happened this time.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Government employees deemed non-essential are put temporarily on unpaid leave - called a furlough.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This will impact the food assistance programme, federally funded preschool, the issuing of student loans and food inspections, <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">and National Parks will close.</a></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It will also affect tax refunds and related administrative activities, such as income and social security numbers - delays here could prevent people from getting other services, such as a mortgage.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 2013 there were some surprising consequences, such as American cemeteries closing in Europe and the US-Canada border only being patrolled by one person.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">How common are shutdowns in US?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Quite common. President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his tenure - though all were relatively brief.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And there were three when Donald Trump was president, including the longest in history at 36 days which ended in January 2019.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That one happened because of disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">estimated that it reduced economic output</a> by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7DA5/production/_131256123_us_shutdown-nc.png.webp alt="Getty Images Graphic showing recent shutdowns" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Shutdowns over budgets are almost unique to US politics.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Under the US system, the different branches of government have to reach an agreement on spending plans before they can become law.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In most countries, budget votes become votes of confidence in the government itself. But because the US has equal and often divided branches of government, that isn't the case.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">What activities are unaffected?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Services classed as essential - mostly related to public safety - continue to operate, and those workers are required to show up without pay.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That usually includes border protection, hospital care, air traffic control, law enforcement, and power grid maintenance.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Other critical functions that do not get their funds from the treasury on an annual basis - social security, Medicare, and Medicaid - are not interrupted.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">What about the White House?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The president of the United States has a guaranteed income.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Congress is also not affected - its members are exempt and, in any case, its funding bill has already been approved.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The US Department of Justice is among those affected - with many lawyers and judges not working during a shutdown. Others are working without pay.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Criminal investigations tend to continue, but almost all federal civil cases, and immigration court cases are affected.</p>BBC in other languages<span data-testid=level1NavText-/innovation class="sc-7be630a6-3 dyMECJ">Innovation</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o67CZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2FjrCmq6SUYsK0ecKapZqckWKBd4WRcHBqbg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-ravens-hair-suddenly-turn-blonde-in-titans-season-4.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why did Ravens hair suddenly turn blonde in Titans season 4?">&larr;
